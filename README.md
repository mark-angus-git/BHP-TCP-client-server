# BHP-TCP-client-server
An exercise from the book Black Hat Python by Justin Seitz and Tim Arnold.

It shows a  way of developing hacking tools on the fly when all you have is python.

In this exercise a TCP server is created to send a message to any client that connects to it.
This could be replaced with a payload or a required file.

A script to emulate a client connecting to this server was also written to ensure the server works as expected.
